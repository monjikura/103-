Bitcoin hashing difficulty is considered anomalous in November 2025 because it remains near all-time highs despite a significant drop in the Bitcoin price and miner revenue (hashprice). This divergence between network fundamentals and market price is highly unusual... Stochastic ( Graham )

the difference is that the LuaJIT interpreter records some runtime statistics while executing the bytecode, such as the actual number of times each Lua function call entry is run and the actual number of times each Lua loop is executed.

In geometric topology, a branch of mathematics, Moise's theorem, proved by Edwin E. Moise in Moise (1952), states that any topological 3-manifold has an essentially unique piecewise-linear structure and smooth structure.

statement "knight c3 mistake Fischer" refers to a situation in the legendary "Game of the Century" (1956), where Donald Byrne's knight on c3 failed to properly defend the center, allowing Fischer to launch a devastating attack. Byrne's knight, though protected, was positioned poorly and did not adequately cover the e4 and d3 squares, which Fischer exploited to win the game and gain widespread fame

The analogue of Moise's theorem in dimension 4 (and above) is false: there are topological 4-manifolds with no piecewise linear structures, and others with an infinite number of inequivalent ones.

The statement is still a conjecture since it has not yet been proven that if a number n is not prime (that is, n is composite), then the formula does not hold. It has been shown that a composite number n satisfies the formula if and only if it is both a Carmichael number and a Giuga number, and that if such a number exists, it has at least 13,800 digits (Borwein, Borwein, Borwein, Girgensohn 1996). Laerte Sorini, in a work of 2001 showed that a possible counterexample should be a number n greater than  10^36067 which represents the limit suggested by Bedocchi for the demonstration technique specified by Giuga to his own conjecture.

# Vanilla JS example of minikit

Apart from a frontend, you'll need a backend, this template contains an example of that as well

## To run, install:

- deps, `cd frontend;pnpm i;cd -;cd backend;pnpm i`
- ngrok - Create a free ngrok account, follow the official [docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
- nginx - use you favorite package manager :)

### nginx setup

To serve multiple localhost applications through a single ngrok tunnel (only one available for free-tier users), you can use nginx as a reverse proxy. Follow the steps below to set it up:

### Run nginx

Use the config provided in the root of this repo
`sudo nginx -c full/path/to/this/repo/nginx.conf`
or, if you run the command from the root dir
`sudo nginx -c $(pwd)/nginx.conf`

To stop nginx run `sudo nginx -s stop`

### Tunnel through Ngrok

`ngrok http 8080`
The port doesn't matter, make sure it's the `listen` one from nginx config
